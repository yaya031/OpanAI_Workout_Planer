### Workout Plan Generator

This Python script generates personalized workout plans based on user input. It utilizes OpenAI's language model to create custom workout plans tailored to individual needs and preferences.

#### Instructions:

1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   - pandas
   - openai

2. Replace `'********'` with your OpenAI API key to utilize the language model.

3. Run the script and follow the prompts to input your details:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Exercise frequency per week
   - Workout goal

4. The script will generate a workout plan based on your input and save it to a text file named `workout_plan_T.txt`.

#### Notes:
- Make sure to keep your OpenAI API key confidential.
- Adjust the filename variable (`filename = "workout_plan_T.txt"`) if you want to change the name or location of the output file.
