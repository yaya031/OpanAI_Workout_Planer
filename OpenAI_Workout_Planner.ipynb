       "\"The difference between the 3rd quantile (Q3) and the 1st quantile (Q1), in terms of a variable like average-price_per_room or any other, is referred to as the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is a measure of variability that describes the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\\n\\nThe 1st quantile (also known as the lower quartile or the 25th percentile) is the value below which 25% of the data falls, and the 3rd quantile (also known as the upper quartile or the 75th percentile) is the value below which 75% of the data falls. By subtracting Q1 from Q3, you get the range that contains the central 50% of the values in the data set.\\n\\nMathematically, IQR is expressed as:\\n\\n\\\\[ IQR = Q3 - Q1 \\\\]\\n\\nWithout the specific values of Q3 and Q1 for the average-price_per_room, it's impossible to calculate the exact value of the IQR. If you have the data or the summary statistics, you would simply need to find the values of Q3 and Q1 and subtract them to find the IQR.\""
